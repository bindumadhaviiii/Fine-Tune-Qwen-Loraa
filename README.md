## Project Overview  
This project explores fine-tuning the **Qwen-0.5B model** for **sentiment analysis** using **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**. The objective is to improve model efficiency while minimizing computational costs, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.  

### Key Features  
- Uses the **IMDb dataset** for sentiment classification.  
- Implements **LoRA**, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method.  
- Achieves **90.2% accuracy** and **89.6% F1-score** with reduced memory consumption.  
- Optimized to run on **Google Colab (T4 GPU Free Tier)**.
